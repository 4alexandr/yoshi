### Get Started Immediately

You **donâ€™t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you're good to go.

## Creating an App

**You'll have to have Node >= 8.9.1 on your local developement machine**.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx
```sh
npx create-yoshi-app my-app
```
*([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))*

### npm
```sh
npm init yoshi-app my-app
```
*`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+*

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies.<br>
No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
```
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

## Basic Usage

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test`
Runs your unit and e2e tests.<br>
Run `npm test --watch` to run the tests in watch mode.<br>
See Yoshi's [CLI Documentation](/docs/faq/YOSHI-API.md#cli) for a complete list of all of Yoshi's CLI capabilities.
